## Architecture Improvements ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Consolidated duplicate hash computation into utils module
- [x] Consolidated cosine similarity into utils module
- [x] Removed unused imports
- [x] Fixed compiler warnings
- [x] Added get_by_id and get_all to VectorStoreBase trait
- [x] Implemented get_all for Memory

## Known Issues
- Streaming not fully implemented
- Connection pooling not implemented
- Caching is basic
- Memory update/delete requires user_id (no global index)

## Performance Considerations
- [ ] Vector store batch operations
- [x] Embedding caching (LRU)
- [ ] Connection pooling
- [ ] Async parallelization
- [ ] Memory-mapped files
- [ ] Compression

## Documentation Needs
- [x] README with CLI and MCP sections
- [x] ARCHITECTURE.md updated
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
